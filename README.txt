# Audio_Narritive_Max
 all project materials, related to audio narritive project

Summary
In the first section I give an overview of what I am going to talk about in this Audio Narrative.  It introduces the listener to the topic and starts to give them an idea of where I am going with the narrative.  It tries to draw the reader in with sound effects and a short clip of a speech.
