# Audio_Narritive_Max
 all project materials, related to audio narritive project

Summary
	I chose to do an audio narrative centered around Martin Luther as I was fairly familiar with him and found him interesting in high school.  He wasn't talked about much in the grand scheme of history which I thought he played in integrate role.  I wanted to display a fun and enjoyable narrative of how he became this rebel against the most powerful institution of his time. From what I read and know, he is a respectable man who put the common people first and fought against exploitation which he very easily could have become a part of. I tried to show listener what I thought would have been said by Luther and others during and post 95 theses.  
	The hardest aspect of this project was trying to write a script that left room for other audio resources. As the first few times. The medium of audio narrative was interesting to experiment with as I don't listen to many audible entertainments except for music.  It made men think how I could change this history lesson into a story that engaged with the listener and kept them captivated. 
	There are not much current engagement in this topic and that is one of the main reasons that I was drew to it. I want my listeners to think about a world without Martin Luther and how it would be different. I'm not very religious myself yeet I do find religion interesting as it shapes the way many people live their lives.  I tried to remain unbiased towards religion as a whole but clearly painted the Catholic Church as the "bad guy" and Martin Luther as the "good guy".
	Audacity was a little difficult for me to use and much prefer premierPro as I have used it before for other classes. Th main issue I had with Audacity was view of the tracks.  I had to continuously zoom in and out while editing to make sure each audio clip was in the right spot and the correct length.  If I had a bigger screen I believe I would have had a much easier time.
	Feedback from you made me change my summary from something veery general and generic to a summary very specific to this project and class. I learned that I need to listen to the .mp3 file in GitHub to make sure it is correct as last time my music was to loud.  I listened to it in audacity and changed the volume, but must not have saved correctly before committing as the music was to powerful and you could not hear the narration.
